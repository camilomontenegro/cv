              I'm a Systems engineer with a long (13 years as a Job, 20 as a hobbie) experience developing almost all kind of software, from desktop applications (using C#/Java), to real time video games (using ActionScript 3 and Java). But, in the last 5 years, I've been focusing on mobile applications, so, I made a lot of applications too many years ago using ActionScript3, Javascript, jQuery, and jQuery Mobile, then I learned Ionic, and I've been doing applications in this great technology, and now I'm learning react-native, a beautiful framework to deal with. I've made some things using Swift and Java as well, but I realized that react-native is more atrative for me than Swift, or Java. That's why I'm making this app, but this is not the first one.
              {"\n"}
              {"\n"}
              Besides that, I've been working for about 10 years in Startup companies, so, I know how they think about technology and what developers do what they need to do in order to create any kind of application, actually, I usually define myself like an "everything will be all right" person, and I like to find and to solve errors not only in my apps, but in another people apps.
              {"\n"}
              {"\n"}
              I like to much learning to code and learn better ways to do my apps, but it doesn't mean that I'm only a coder, because in the last years I've had the oportunity to lead developer teams in many projects, such as C4 Systems, like mobile aplications (iOS, Android), and wep applications as well.
              {"\n"}
              {"\n"}
              And for that last reason I've worked a lot with JS technologies, because in Startup's companies usually is very important to make one application, but this app must be able to run in any platform.
